Islanders is a randomized puzzle based speedrun game, where you must collect 4 randomly generated trees, craft them into a boat, and sail off the dock. Caves can be used to travel faster, and there is a timer that records how long you took. Compete against friends, or against yourself, to try and be the fastest at beating this game!

Lore:

Timmy loved his overalls. Timmy loved them so much that he spent a lot of money on them, and it all took a turn for the worst when Timmy's family started getting angry. They would take his money to make him spend less on overalls, but it just made him spend less on food. So to teach him a lesson, they left him out at sea with just him and his overalls. Will Timmy be able to escape the island, and go back home to his overalls? Or will he starve to death on this island? Let's find out.
